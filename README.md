Description:

Enables user to register or login if already have account. He will be redirected to home page, 
where he has button that leads to his profile.
On his profile it is possible to search other users from db in order to find friend.
When he sents request to someone, that other person can accept or reject his requests.
If accepts, those two users go on each other friends list and then it is possible for them to chat. The same thing happens
when user sends friend request to other person.
While chating they can see all messeges they sent to each other before.
There is option to chose modes:dark and light.
User has option to logout whenever he wants and then he will be redirected to login page.
